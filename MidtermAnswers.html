        <h1>Midterm</h1>

        <p>Although the instructions for this week's assignment did not call it a "milestone", I assume that this is technically a milestone assignment. The goal of this assignment is to utilize Google's "Styled maps wizard" to define at least three modified base map styles and integrate the JSON generated by the wizard into you r new Google Map page. The new page is suposed to be made as a new, free-standing web page based upon the Google Map that was created as part of week 3's milestone assignment.</p>
