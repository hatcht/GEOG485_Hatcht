	<h1>Question 1</h1><h2>Which command line utility would you use to determine the following (4 pts each)
The spatial extent of a GML file (choose one)?
	<h2>• proj</h2>
	<h2>• cs2cs</h2>
	<h2>• gdalinfo</h2>
	<h2>• ogrinfo</h2>
        <p>I would use ogr info because GML files are an XML grammar for representing geospatial features and their associated attributes.  Features are generally points, lines and polygons which are vector data.  Ogrinfo is designed to return info about vector over say gdalinfo which is designed more for raster data.</p>
