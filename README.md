Geography 485 portfolio _ Hatcht
This is the first time I have ever given thought to what makes up a webpage.  I have always just thought that internet pages were like word documents that were somehow made accessable to the whole world, and I was amazed to realize 
that there are "languages"/coding that make a webpage operational.  I have set up this Github account for a UNM GEOG 485 Class that will be teaching me the world of internet mapping...this is something I never had any interest in but I do see the value in learning this stuff.  Not only do I need to have a passing grade in this course to graduate this coming May, but I also need to learn how to create internet web pages (maps or no maps) for a potential non-profit organization I am trying to create.  I will need to construct a user friendly and extremely dynamic website and I hope that this class will help me get nearer to my goal.
