Question 1
    What request type is common across all three (WMS, WFS, WCS) OGC web services that we have learned about? 

Answer the following questions about a WMS GetCapabilities request

Question 2
    What are the required parameters, and what do they represent? 
    What is returned in response to a WMS GetCapabilities request? 

Answer the following questions about a WMS GetMap request

Question 3
    What are the required parameters, and what do they represent? 
    What is returned in response to a WMS GetMap request? 

    What is the significance of transparency in WMS requests?
Question 4

    What OGC request would you use to inform the configuration of a client application (like ArcGIS) about an OGC service that you want to add layers from?

Which OGC request would you submit under the following circumstances (include both the service type [e.g. WMS, WFS, WCS], and the request [e.g. GetMap, GetCapabilities, GetCoverage, etc.] in your answer)

Question 5
    You want a map image representing three layers of data in a single JPEG for a specified area of interest. 
    You want to retrieve data representing geometries and associated attributes for a road network, with the returned data in GML. 

    You want to retrieve data representing a digital elevation model (a raster dataset) in the form of a GeoTIFF.
Question 6 - What are the EPSG codes of the following Spatial Reference Systems
    WGS 84 (Geodetic CRS [geographic 2d]) 
    NAD83 / UTM zone 13N 

    NAD27 / UTM zone 13N

Use the cs2cs utility to convert the following WGS84 Geographic Coordinates into UTM Zone 13, NAD83 coordinates. Include your cs2cs command and output in your writeup.

Question 7
    35°14′19.29″ N, 107°36′30.67″ W (Mount Taylor Summit) 
    34°16′40.34″ N, 103°19′28.49″ W (Blackwater Draw) 

Retrieve the GetCapabilities XML response from the following WMS, and answer the following questions.

Question 8
    What is the Title of the service? 
    Who is the Contact Person for questions about the service? 
    What are the available image formats for the GetMap request for this service? 

    What are the SRS/CRS’s for which layers from this service are available (remember that nested layers inherit the SRS/CRS of their parent layers).
Question 9

    Formulate a GetMap request for the “tl_2010_35_bg10” layer from this service, for a 500x500 pixel map image that is 0.05-degrees wide and 0.05-degress high, with the SW corner of the map image located at 35°N and -106°45'E. Include in your write-up the complete GetMap request and the returned map image.
