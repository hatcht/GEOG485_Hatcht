		<h1>My Geography 485L/585L Home Page</h1>
		<p>About me</p>
		<p>Why I'm taking the course</p>
		<p>I am taking GEOG 485 because I have been working on a USGS land management project for nearing six years and eventually the project is aimed to be an online interactive map.</p>


		<h2>Topics I'm interested in</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>adding maps to webpages so landmanagers can zoom to desired info, desplay desired info in the form of points, polylines and polygons and pull numerical values from selections in the map.  Basically I want to have something that opperates very much like simple querying from Arcmap.</li>
			<li>I plan to create a website that will help locals in the ABQ area locate "trading depots" that my future company will build around town.  I can't disclose much info about this project but I want the internet web page to geographically link people together based on similarities and then direct them to a "trade depot" somewhere closest to the two of them.</li>
			<li>Other topics include trying to generate webpages that will shape human behavious through incentive programs...all of this is associated with non-profit efforts.</li>
		</ul>


		<h2>Types of data I have worked with (themes & formats)</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>when it comes to web mapping, I have not delt with anything...this is a new and scary world to me.  but when it comes to maps, I have done a lot of work with numberous map formats.</li>
			<li>more data types ... there are none to mention...</li>
		</ul>
