	<h1>Lab Assignment / Assignment #2</h1>
	<h2>Question 1 : From examining the display in your web browser and the structure of the source code in the page, what effect (if any) does the white space (i.e. tabs, blank lines, multiple spaces) have on what is displayed in the browser? </h2>
	<p>It appears that white spaces and blank lines would show up as larger gaps between written language on the page.  This would allow the creator to make the title have a larger gap between it and the rest of the content on the page.  This template text does not exactly have any examples of this except that each line of text has been tabed to the same possition vertically which will make all text on the page show up in line vertically.</p>
	<h2>Question 2 : How are the <h1> and <h2> elements from the source code displayed differently in the browser?</h2>
	<p>h1 is bolder font and a little larger since it is the larger title of the document, while h2 is the question headers.  this is to sepparate questions from the answers</p>
	<h2>What type of element would you use to create additional list elements in either the “topic” or “data type” lists on the page.</h2>
	<p>I might start with another <head> section, or I could just use <title> again and begin a new list that lists similarly as using h1 for the questions and p for the plain text answers. </p>
