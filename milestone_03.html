      <h1>Lab Assignment / Assignment #3</h1>
      
        <h2>Question 1 : What area do you want to depict in your map? Why? </h2>
        <p>I will be depicting an area amounting to approximately 80,000 hectares of land in the North-East region of Louisiana.  This is an area known as the Singer Tract and it was the last location where Ivory-billed Woodpeckers (IBWO) were last studied in their natural habitat.  This was also known as their last stronghold in the continental united states and the last of their habitat to not be chopped down due to U.S. expansion and war efforts during the Civil War and World War II.  This landscape has undergone many changes over the years but thankfully ecologists like James T. Tanner took field notes while he observed IBWOs in this habitat in the 30 and into the 40s.  With field notes and due to military activity during the Civil War, this area has extensive historic map coverage which all aid in creating an accurate recreation of what type of habitat supported the IBWO back in the 30s and prior.  This information will help us understand why this species is extinct today and understand how to manage forests better in the future for other species.</p>
        
        <h2>Question 2 : What is the center point (latitude and longitude) of your area of interest?</h2>
        <p>The approximate center point of the area I want to picture in my map is: 91°22'4.085"W  32°17'2.594"N.</p>
        
        <h2>Question 3 : What style of map (road, satelilite, hybrid, terrain) is appropriate for your map? why?</h2>
        <p>For this initial tutorial, I think it would be to my benefit to load a modern Google map so I plan on loading just a simple road map but Ideally, and eventually, I hope to design a website that will allow the user to turn on an off various maps such as Civil War army maps, old road maps, old topo maps, old land use maps, etc…</p>
        
        <h2>Question 4 : What is the scale of your map (local, regional, continental, global)? How will this translate into your selection of an appropriate default zoom level for you map?</h2>
        <p>The scale of my map will be local because it is only a small section of land located across mainly three parishes in North-East Louisiana.  The second half of this question implies that the map that I will be putting into my website will be set to one zoom level, so until I have pasted the map into a webpage, I won’t know how big a map I will be pasting and thus how to set the zoom to make the map worth viewing.</p>
        
        <h2>Question 5 : Embed a Google Map in your writeup that is based upon your responses to questions 1-4 above.</h2>
